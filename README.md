### Welcome to my Github!

#### Please feel free to browse my public repositories

#### The recent gap of activity is due to my current employer's preference for Atlassian (ie Bitbucket and Jira)



#### If you live in Upstate NY, or just want to participate in virtual exchanges, please join the Syracuse Software Development Meet-Up!
